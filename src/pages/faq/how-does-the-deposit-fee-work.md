title: How does the deposit fee work?
answer: The deposit will be used for the final month training fee in July at
  completion of the season (Sept - July). Should you decide to withdraw your
  daughter from our club, you are required to provide us with one month's notice
  and the deposit payment will be used for the last month's fees. Should you
  withdraw your daughter without notice, the club will retain the deposit as
  final payment. All information included in our terms and conditions point 1.2
