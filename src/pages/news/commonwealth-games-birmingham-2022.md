Iï»¿t's with immense pride and happiness that we announce that our senior gymnast ***Saffron Severn*** alongside her teammate *Alice Leaper* (Fylde Coast) and *Marfa Ekimova* (West London) has won the bronze medal representing **Team England** at the [Commonwealth Games](https://www.birmingham2022.com/news/2719458/canada-crowned-rhythmic-gymnastics-champions).

Saffron concluded the all around qualification 12th earning more than 1 PB and qualified for the [clubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMkK449psVk&t=14s) final.

What an amazing experience for Saffron and for our judges *Stefano* and *Becca* who have had the privilege of being involved with the RG  competition as officials.
