As this fantastic season has come to an end, we would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you for being part of the Rhythmic Excellence community.

To our amazing **gymnasts** – your dedication, passion, and progress have truly made this year one to remember.\
\
To our **coaches** (*Alisija, Anastasia, Dana, Eleonora, Kathryn, Saffron & Stefano*) – thank you for your tireless work, care, and guidance in helping each athlete grow.\
\
To the **volunteers** and parents who supported us along the way (especially our amazing welfare officers *Prasad & Lobna*) – whether by helping at events, assisting behind the scenes, or cheering from the sidelines – we are deeply grateful for your contribution and trust.

This year, we’ve achieved so much together – from competitions and displays to daily progress in the gym. It’s been a season filled with hard work, milestones, and wonderful memories.

To those who are moving on, we wish you nothing but success and happiness in your next chapters. And to those returning in September – we can’t wait to welcome you back for another exciting season of growth and excellence.

Thank you once again for being part of our journey.

Wishing you all a lovely summer ahead,\
\
With warmest regards,\
The Rhythmic Excellence Team
