RE 2nd Friendly Tournament

We are extremely happy to have hosted our second competition, we’ve got more than 60 gymnasts (level 3 to 5) competing from 10 clubs from in and out of London.\
A special thank you goes to all our coaches and volunteers (including our amazing gymnasts) for all the help and support, we wouldn’t have made it without you!



THANK YOU!
