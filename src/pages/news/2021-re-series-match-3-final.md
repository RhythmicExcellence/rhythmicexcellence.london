***Great final round of the RE Series 2021!***

The 3 teams have performed all the 6 routines (free, rope, hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon) each and have shown important improvements!

**Leyla's team** (Team Blue) has won the last round with a total score of 68.4 points. The team was finally complete with all the members performing and has performed 6 quite good routines (still with the captain's performances' simplified and without BDs to avoid slowing down Leyla's rehabilitation). Well done to the gymnasts: *Miya* (free), *Elizabeth P*. (rope and clubs) *Rebecca* (ball) and *Leyla* (hoop and ribbon).

**Dana's team** (Team Yellow) finished second with a total score of 59.400 points. Well done to all the gymnasts: *Dana* (ribbon), *Adriana* (rope and hoop), *Rhiann* (free) and *Emilia* (ball and clubs).

**Saffron's team** (Team Red) has won the bronze medal with a total score of 56 points (way higher than the previous rounds and still without the support of the captain's performance). Well done to all the gymnasts: *Elizabeth* (rope and ribbon), *Amane* (hoop and clubs) and *Pola* (free and ball).



### Final ranking after 3 rounds:

### 1st - *Dana's Team* 16 points
