***Wonderful step back to the carpet for our squad gymnasts!***

The 3 teams have performed all the 6 routines (free, rope, hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon) each and have shown great improvements!

**Dana's team** (Team Yellow) has won the first match with a total of 53.200 points (and the 2 best scores of the competition earned by Dana with ball and Adriana with hoop). Well done to all the gymnasts: *Dana* (ball and clubs), *Adriana* (hoop), *Rhiann* (free) and *Emilia* (rope and ribbon).

**Saffron's team** (Team Red) has won the silver medal with a total of 41.900 points (still impressive as the team couldn't count on the captain's performance due to her injury). Well done to all the gymnasts: *Elizabeth* (free and rope), *Amane* (hoop and ribbon) and *Pola* (ball and clubs).

**Leyla's team** (Team Blue) has suffered the absence of Rebecca and couldn't count on the captain's performance either but has still performed well earning the best score on free! The total score for the team is 27.700, well done to the gymnasts: *Miya* (free) and *Elizabeth P*. (rope and clubs).

Thanks to all our judges: *Rebecca Bunce* (D3/4), *Stefano Sirianni* (D1/2), *Johanna Chudzik* (A) and *Francesca fazzari* (E).

Looking forward for the second match planned on Friday 4th June.
