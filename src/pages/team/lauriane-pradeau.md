  Rebecca started gymnastics at the age of 3 in a local sports hall. She was then recommended to join a professional club as she showed potential for artistic gymnastics. At the age of 10 she moved over to rhythmic and found this was where her passion lied. Rebecca originally coached individuals where she had 2 gymnasts qualify for GBR squad. Many years later she started a group program at her previous club where within 5 years she has had 2 groups (espoir and senior) qualify for GBR squad and junior British champions in 2016. Rebecca also is a brevet judge who regularly travels abroad to judge for GBR, with her most prestigious competition being the 1st Junior World Championships.
