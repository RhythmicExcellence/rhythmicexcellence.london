  Alisija is currently attending the UKCC Level 1 Rhythmic Gymnastics coaching course and the UKCC Level 1 Rhythmic Gymnastics Judge


  I started rhythmic gymnastics in Lithuania from 4 years old and for 13 years I was competing professionally. I am a national Lithuanian and international competition winner and prize winner (in countries like Russia, Italy, Croatia, Germany, Turkey, Luxembourg and others), as well during my stay in France (2019), I was qualified for the final French Rhythmic Gymnastics championships. I had many summer training sessions with famous names in rhythmic gymnastics: Dimitrova (Bulgaria), Kanaeva (Russia) & others. I like to work as a part of a team, able to communicate with gymnasts and other members of staff, able to motivate and assist gymnasts to develop new skills and share my knowledge safely.
