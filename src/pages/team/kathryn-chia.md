  Rhythmic gymnastics was my first love and has continued to be my greatest
  passion. I feel so lucky to have found something that brings me such joy and
  (almost) never feels like work!


  I have been coaching in London and Singapore for 3 years. During this time, I have worked with gymnasts of all ages and experience levels. As a coach, I endeavour to be adaptable, patient and positive. Above all, I strive to instil a love for this sport in all that I teach.


  I enjoy keeping up to date on the rhythmic code of points and always want to learn more. In the future, I aspire to become an FIG brevet judge. I study Nutrition and Medical Sciences at UCL, and will soon be doing my final year dissertation on the role of nutrition on injury prevention amongst Rhythmic Gymnasts.


  As a gymnast, I was part of the national squad in Singapore for 5 years before I took a break from the sport in 2020. In 2023, I returned to Rhythmic and it has been the most fantastic journey!
