  Ex-elite rhythmic gymnast who represented GB in 2017 in Estonia Miss Valentine
  and Greece . 

  British champions in 2018 and English Champions 2018. 

  Training as an Osteopath, Maddy wants to go down the route of becoming an osteopath specialised in professional sports players in gymnastics, and dancing sports. 


  Madison started when she was 5 years old, and competed as an elite group gymnast for 13 years. 

  She tells: I have always had RG a part of my life, and once I quit, it was like something was missing. When I moved to London, I was looking for a job whilst in university and applied to Rhythmic Excellence. Once i started coaching, I knew I never wanted to leave RG again. I love seeing the gymnasts' faces when they have done something well. Coaching has helped me personally, professionally and mentally; the team is so lovely and coaching is always a laugh.
