Gymnast Group Contract

Gymnast’s placement on the Squad Group Team is based on merit and performance. Gymnasts will be part of this team on the condition that they maintain the skills, attendance (as per RE club rules) and dedication required.

The pathway

The group will need to take part at the regional grades which takes place at the beginning of the year. After this competition the National TC will separate the groups into level 3, 4 (National level) and 5 (Elite level). We are waiting for clarification on how groups will qualify for the English Championships 2024. Junior and Senior groups that are ranked Level 4 or 5 will be eligible to compete at the Junior/Senior British Open in early 2024. Level 4 groups will qualify for the NDP finals and level 5 groups will qualify to compete at the British Championships but will need to be British in order to be ranked (British only).

Terms and conditions

Gymnasts in the group will be training 4 days per week. Attendance and participation in the competitions set out below is mandatory. If a gymnast is unable to\
attend a rehearsal practice, competition or tournament, they must have a written excuse\
from a parent, teacher, or doctor. We understand that school comes first and some sessions may be missed due to exams and/or trips, however gymnasts are expected to make any other appointments/commitments on days in which they do not train.

If you miss more than 2 classes a month then an email will be sent to parents. If this continues for a further 2 months then the gymnast will be expelled from the team.

The gymnast understands that they will not take part in any individual grading competition or selection events; individual work will only be focused on routines to practise apparatus handling in aid for group training.

As there are more than the minimum number of gymnasts required to make a group, not all will compete at every competition. We will make the selection for each competition a minimum of 2 weeks before and it will be based on the level of competition, attendance, performance, injury and commitment.

The gymnast and the Parents understand that the Gymnast once in the group is expected to complete the whole season. In case of unjustified withdrawal from the group Rhythmic Excellence will retain the deposit fee as specified below.

The group deposit will be £200 and this will be returned to the parents upon completion of the season.

Rhythmic Excellence will provide Group Leotard and Equipment for hire. It will be the gymnasts’ responsibility to take care of leotards and equipment.

Leotards and apparatus clarifications

●  If a leotard is completely lost or damaged beyond repair, the gymnast will be responsible for covering the costs of a new leotard

●  Leotards must be hand-washed after every event. Please make sure that it is not put in the washing machine or tumble dryer. The leotard should be ringed out and then hung to dry, if you are not sure please talk to the coaches team

●  Leotards must be well looked after and not placed in their training bag with equipment /drinks etc. Leotards should be placed in a separate bag or leotard holder

●  If a piece of apparatus is completely lost or damaged beyond repair, the gymnast will be responsible for covering the costs of a new piece of apparatus

●  Group apparatus must not be left out of their apparatus holder

Parents also understand that away competitions in other locations may require overnight stays, it is the Parents responsibility to get their child to the competition and orientation. Once at the venue and they have registered they will always be chaperoned and part of a safe group. After the completion of the competition, gymnasts will be returned to their parents and will be their responsibility. When staying overnight we would encourage and prefer the gymnasts to stay in the same hotel so that hair and make-up can be organised and done together. They can also transfer to the venue together. Parents are responsible for paying for the gymnast’s own transport, food and lodging on long or overnight trips, and cover coach and judge expenses.
