subtitle: From 6 years up
description: Our recreational gymnastics programme is designed to engage
  children age 6 and over in gymnastics in a fun, friendly and developmental
  way.  The aspiration is to develop your child's physical literacy through
  gymnastics. During our training children will develop their confidence and
  motivation for sport and physical activity, as well as their physical movement
  skills, coordination, flexibility, strength, stamina and acrobatics. Whether
  they choose to continue with rhythmic gymnastics or will decide to pursue
  another sport, their experience during the programme will provide them with an
  excellent basis for progression into an active and healthy lifestyle.  Who is
  this programme for? Everybody who wishes to participate, no matter the age or
  level of gymnastic experience. We will teach the fundamentals of rhythmic
  gymnastics and ensure that children develop confidence in using gymnastics
  hand-held apparatus safely before moving to more challenging exercises.
