title: General Gymnastics Course (from 6 years old up)
description: Our recreational general gymnastics class for kids is a fun and
  introductory way for children to explore various gymnastics activities. It's
  designed for enjoyment and basic skill development, teaching fundamental
  movements like jumping, rolling, balancing, and basic gymnastics techniques.
  These classes focus on building coordination, strength, flexibility, and
  confidence in a safe and playful environment without the pressure of
  competitive gymnastics.  All our classes include warm up and flexibility,
  strength and conditioning, basic acrobatic study, elements, cardio &
  endurance.
