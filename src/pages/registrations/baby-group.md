title: RG Baby Group (only a few spots available left in the Monday class)
subtitle: From 4 to 6 years old
description: Our baby group course is a delightful introduction to the world of
  movement and coordination for the youngest aspiring gymnasts. Tailored for
  toddlers and preschoolers, these classes focus on fostering fundamental motor
  skills through playful activities, music, and basic gymnastics exercises.
  Under the guidance of experienced coaches, little ones explore the joy of
  movement, enhance their balance, and develop flexibility in a safe and
  supportive environment. The classes often incorporate colourful props,
  rhythmic elements, and interactive games, creating a fun and engaging
  atmosphere that sparks a love for physical activity from the very beginning of
  a child's gymnastics journey.
